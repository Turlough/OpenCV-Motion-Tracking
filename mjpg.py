	Utility class to read jpgs from an mpeg stream.
	Usage: Call get_frames, passing it the url of the stream to process,
	and a callback for however you want to process each returned jpg.
	By default, this runs asynchronously, and any frames that were 
	missed while processing are discarded.

	callback: any function that takes a JPG as a parameter, e.g. callback(jpg)
